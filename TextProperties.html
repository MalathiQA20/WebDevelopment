    <h1>Lord of the Rings</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
        The Lord of the Rings is an epic[1] high fantasy novel[a] by the English author and scholar J. R. R. Tolkien.
        Set in Middle-earth, the world at some distant time in the past, the story began as a sequel to Tolkien's 1937
        children's book The Hobbit, but eventually developed into a much larger work. Written in stages between 1937 and
        1949, The Lord of the Rings is one of the best-selling books ever written, with over 150 million copies sold.

        The title names the story's main antagonist, the <b>Dark Lord Sauron</b> , who had in an earlier age created the
        One
        Ring to rule the other Rings of Power as the ultimate weapon in his campaign to conquer and rule all of
        Middle-earth. From homely beginnings in the Shire, a hobbit land reminiscent of the English countryside, the
        story ranges across Middle-earth, following the quest to destroy the One Ring mainly through the eyes of the
        hobbits Frodo, Sam, Merry and Pippin.

        The Lord of the Rings has since been reprinted many times and translated into at least 38 languages.[b] The
        enduring popularity of The Lord of the Rings has led to numerous references in popular culture, the founding of
        many societies by fans of Tolkien's works,[5] and the publication of many books about Tolkien and his works. It
        has inspired numerous derivative works including artwork, music, films and television, video games, board games,
        and subsequent literature. Award-winning adaptations of The Lord of the Rings have been made for radio, theatre,
        and film. It has been named Britain's best novel of all time in the BBC's The Big Read.

    <h2>The Fellowship of the Ring</h2>
    <p>
        The prologue explains that the book is "largely concerned with hobbits", and tells of their origins in a
        migration from the east; of how they smoke "pipe-weed"; of how the Shire, where most of them live, is organised;
        and how the narrative follows on from The Hobbit, in which the hobbit Bilbo Baggins finds the Ring, which had
        been in the possession of the creature Gollum.

    <h2>The Two Towers</h2>
    <p>
        A party of large Orcs, Uruk-hai, sent by Saruman, and other Orcs sent by Sauron and led by Grishnákh, attack the
        Fellowship. Boromir tries to protect Merry and Pippin from the Orcs, but they kill him and capture the two
        hobbits. Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas decide to pursue the Orcs taking Merry and Pippin to Saruman. In the kingdom
        of Rohan, the Orcs are killed by Riders of Rohan, led by Éomer. Merry and Pippin escape into Fangorn Forest,
        where they are befriended by Treebeard, the oldest of the tree-like Ents. Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas track the
        hobbits to Fangorn. There they unexpectedly meet Gandalf.
